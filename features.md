use seaborn for the graphs
make all the graphs smallish and inline with the text not by itself
make the report look somewhat "pretty"
follow Tufte's guideliness on graphing and charting to the letter
read the data file
list all the categories and how much the total was
generate a markdown output file with whatever information
put it and any images into a directory called output
organize the overall directory of the program as a standard python package
create a histogram showing total donations amounts every year
create a historgram showing total number of donations every year
delete any obsolete files, dont leave them lying around
add a section of charities that have received a single donation, 
add a section of charities which had multiple donations that started at some point but have since been stopped
add a section going into depth on the 10 charities who have recieved the highest total donations
going into depth means showing a list of the individual donations. showing their tax-id number
include a graph of donations over the last 10 years only if there were any
consider two charities the same if their tax-id is the same. Dont go by their name
use charity navigator api to look up description of a charity
use that description in the detailed report
make a list of charities that meet this criterion: we have donated to them consistently over the last 5 years, and in amounts exceeding 500 per year
